# Blog-Database-System
- This project is a complete design and implementation of the **backend** of a blog site application with MySQL.
- It focuses on the fundamental concepts of Relational Databases (RDBMSs), namely tables, views, procedures, functions,triggers and normalization.
- The tables are in Third Normal Form (3NF).


## Tables:
1. USER - Blog users.
2. POST - Posts uploaded by users.
3. COMMENT - Comments written by users on posts.
4. CATEOGRY - Stores all topics/categories 
5. POST_CATEGORY - Stores the categories associated with the posts
6. POST_LIKES - Stores the likes made by users on posts
